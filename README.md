# Project-Chainsaw
Project Chainsaw game, with outdated code but the assets and frontend still remained as it is today.

Dedicated to dear Shoyo, who treated me and many of his other workers unfairly and ultimately scams his members by still taking money through patreon for a game 
that will never be finished.

[I DO NOT RECOMMEND USING THE SCRIPTS THAT ARE IN THE MAIN GAME, THEY ARE RUSHED AND BADLY SCRIPTED]
